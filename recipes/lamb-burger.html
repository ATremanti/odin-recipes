<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A delicious lamb burger stuffed with creamy goat cheese made with fresh Rosemary and spices for a real Greek flavor!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup diced onion</li>
    <li>2 pounds ground lamb</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>1 cup bread crumbs</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>4 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 ounces soft goat cheese</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the onions in the oil until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Gently knead together the softened onions, lamb, egg, bread crumbs, garlic, salt, and pepper. Divide the mixture into 6 parts and roll into balls, then cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
    <li>Mix together the goat cheese, extra-virgin olive oil, basil, and oregano until well combined; cover and chill for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Working with one portion of meat at a time, make an indentation in the center of the ball with your thumb. Fill the indentation with a heaping tablespoon of the goat cheese mixture.
    Gently pull and form the meat patty around the cheese filling, making a burger-shaped patty. Repeat with each ball of the lamb mixture.</li>
    <li>Grill the patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and well done, about 8 minutes per side.</li>
</ol>
